## What is it

Ever wanted to hear your favourite radio station from a video game IRL?  
Well I wanted.

So I decided to recreate my favourite radio stations on `Spotify`. [@h4llow3En](https://github.com/h4llow3En) additionally offered to create them on `Apple Music`.  
So here we bring you a list of `Game Radio Station`.

## What is in it

In every file you find links to the respective playlist and a table of songs with artists that are played on the radio station.

## Weakness

Unfortunately there are songs that are not on `Spotify` or `Apple Music` so some of the Playlists are incomplete. Another thing is, that some of the specific mixes are not available. So we try to provide a similar version if the song. Sometimes songs are under some kind of region lock I guess. (At least on `Spotify` you can see songs that are not available) For those songs we also try to provide a similar version.

Because of that there are indicators in the lists.  
* ✓ Indicates that the song is available on the specific platform
* (✓) Indicates that not the correct version of the song is available on the specific platform
* ? Indicates an unclear status about the version of the song (This is applied to most of the classical pieces)
* ✗ Indicates the song is missing on the platform

## Contribute

You found a mistake in one of the lists or a better version of a song or the song is now available. [Let us know](https://github.com/MarauderXtreme/game-radio-playlists/issues/new)  
Feele free to [add](https://github.com/MarauderXtreme/game-radio-playlists/compare) other radio station and submit them. There is a template which you can use to add other radio stations.

## The Future

For now we will continue to add radio stations we like. You are welcome to contribute playlists on other platforms like `Deezer` or `Amazon Music`.
