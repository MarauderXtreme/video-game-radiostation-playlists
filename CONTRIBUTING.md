# Contribution Guidelines

This is a private project and if it should grow we heavily depend on your assistance and your support. But please stick to some guidelines I've listed here. This helps us to make the project better faster.

## Pull Request General

**The pull request should have a useful title. Please refrain from using something like `Fixed Typo`, `Updated README`. At least include the documents, you edited and if possbile what you updated.**

## Issue General

**Before opening an issue, please check if there are recent issues with the same topic or content. Please contribute to them first instead of opening your own issue. This helps in working.**

## Becoming a maintainer

**By adding a playlist to this collection, you will become the maintainer of this list. So please have a look on the issue tracker. You probably get assigned if something is not correct with your playlist**

## Adding new playlists

* Please stick to the [template](template/template.md)
* Please make sure there isn't already a playlist for the radio station on the particular streaming platform
* Please don't pile up new lists. Rather make a PR for each playlist.
* If you can only add a playlist for one platform, please mention @MarauderXtreme for the Spotify verion or @h4llow3En for the Apple Music verion
* With adding a playlist you accept to be the primary maintainer of the list
  * If people report issues, you will get asigned
  * If you cannot maintain a list anymore, please create an issue and we will try to transfer the ownership

## Report missing songs

* Instead of creating your own playlist and submit it, please just let the maintainer know, that there is a song missing and share the link if possible or at least the full title to find it.
* If a song got removed, please report this problem. We try to update the status as fast as possible

## Adding new songs and correcting versions

* If a song or the correct version of it is made availabe for a platform, please report this in an issue and provide link or the full title so that the maintainer is able to include it.

## Correcting Order

* Some radio stations may have a fixed order in which the songs are played. Spotify and Apple Music keep adding and removing songs. Because of that the correct order cannot be achieved in most cases.
